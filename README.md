## Overview

The **Employee Leave Management System** is a web-based application that streamlines leave management. Both employees and administrators interact through a Filament 3 dashboard, with role-based visibility controlling access to features like leave requests, balance tracking, user management, and reports.

## System Design

The system employs a **modular, layered architecture** with Filament 3 as the primary UI, ensuring scalability and maintainability:

- **Presentation Layer**:
  - **Filament 3 Dashboard**: Single Dashboard UI for employees and admins.
  - Role-based visibility: Employees see leave application,leave balance,leave history and Holidays pages and Admins see user management, leave approvals, holidays, and reports.
  - Dynamic page rendering using Laravel‚Äôs role-checking logic (e.g., Filament policies).

- **Application Layer**:
  - Filament resources handle business logic (e.g., leave validation, balance updates, report generation).

- **Data Layer**:
  - SQLite (default) or MySQL (via Docker) with Eloquent ORM for secure, efficient queries.
  - Migrations ensure consistent schema; seeders provide test data.

- **Integration Layer**:
  - Filament Authentication for secure, role-based access control.

- **Scalability**:
  - Database indexing (e.g., `user_id`) and caching for performance.
  - Filament‚Äôs optimized rendering for dynamic dashboards.

## Database Design

The database schema, depicted in `er_diagram.png`, ensures efficiency and integrity:

- **Users**:
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (employee/admin), `is_active`.
  - `role` drives Filament visibility; `is_active` controls account access.

- **Leave Requests**:
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `leave_type` (Casual/Earned), `start_date`, `end_date`, `status` (Pending/Approved/Rejected), `reason`.
  - Foreign key `user_id` links to `users`.

- **Leave Balances**:
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `leave_type`, `balance`.
  - Auto-updates on request submission/rejection.

- **Holidays**:
  - Fields: `id`, `date`, `name`.
  - Excludes non-working days from leave calculations.

- **Design Principles**:
  - **Normalization**: 3NF to reduce redundancy.
  - **Constraints**: Foreign keys, unique `email`.
  - **Indexing**: On `user_id` for fast queries.

## Web Application Security

The system prioritizes security, leveraging Filament 3 and Laravel features:

- **Authentication**:
  - Filament Authentication with Bcrypt-hashed passwords.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) via `role` field, enforced in Filament policies.
  - Employees cannot access admin pages; visibility is dynamically hidden.

- **Data Protection**:
  - HTTPS for secure communication.
  - CSRF tokens (Laravel middleware) prevent cross-site attacks.

- **Database Security**:
  - Eloquent ORM prevents SQL injection with parameterized queries.
  - `.env` files (excluded from Git) store sensitive credentials.

- **Session Management**:
  - Encrypted cookies for secure sessions.
  - Configurable timeouts to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Additional Measures**:
  - Rate limiting on login attempts(5 attempts per minute).
  - Input validation (e.g., leave dates, emails) in Filament forms.
  - Regular Composer updates to patch vulnerabilities.

## Coding Standards

The codebase follows strict standards for maintainability:

- **PHP Standards**:
  - [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) for style (4-space indentation, camelCase).
  - Consistent naming (e.g., `LeaveRequestResource`, `leave_requests`).

- **Laravel/Filament Conventions**:
  - Filament resources (e.g., `UserResource`, `LeaveApplicationResource`) for dashboard pages.
  - Routes in `routes/web.php` with RESTful names (e.g., `leave.request.store`).

- **Code Quality**:
  - Type hints and return types for robustness.
  - Docblocks for classes/methods.

## Key Features

- **User Management**:
  - Employees register; admins activate accounts via Filament Dashboard.
  - Role-based dashboard visibility (employee/admin).

- **Leave Request**:
  - Employees submit Casual/Earned leave requests in Filament.
  - Admins approves or rejects.

- **Leave Balance**:
  - Real-time balance tracking in Filament dashboard.
  - Deducts leave balance when submitting application.
  - Restores leave balance when Rejected.

- **Holidays**:
  - Excludes weekends and holidays, managed in Filament.
  - Ensures accurate leave calculations.

- **Reports**:
  - Employees view their own leave history/summaries in Filament.
  - Admins see all of the employee's history/summaries.
