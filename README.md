## Overview

The **Employee Leave Management System** is a web-based application that streamlines leave management. Both employees and administrators interact through a Filament 3 dashboard, with role-based visibility controlling access to features like leave requests, balance tracking, user management, and reports.

## System Design

The system employs a **modular, layered architecture** with Filament 3 as the primary UI, ensuring scalability and maintainability:

- **Presentation Layer**:
  - **Filament 3 Dashboard**: Single Dashboard UI for employees and admins.
  - Role-based visibility: Employees see leave application,leave balance,leave history and Holidays pages and Admins see user management, leave approvals, holidays, and reports.
  - Dynamic page rendering using Laravel‚Äôs role-checking logic (e.g., Filament policies).

- **Application Layer**:
  - Filament resources handle business logic (e.g., leave validation, balance updates, report generation).

- **Data Layer**:
  - SQLite (default) or MySQL (via Docker) with Eloquent ORM for secure, efficient queries.
  - Migrations ensure consistent schema; seeders provide test data.

- **Integration Layer**:
  - Filament Authentication for secure, role-based access control.

- **Scalability**:
  - Database indexing (e.g., `user_id`) and caching for performance.
  - Filament‚Äôs optimized rendering for dynamic dashboards.

## Database Design

The database schema, depicted in `er_diagram.png`, is designed for efficiency, integrity, and scalability, supporting the core features of user management, leave requests, balances, and holidays. The schema uses SQLite (default) or MySQL (via Docker) with Eloquent ORM for secure queries.

### Tables

- **Users**:
  - **Fields**: `id` (PK, auto-increment), `name` (varchar), `email` (varchar, unique), `password` (varchar), `role` (varchar, default: 'employee'), `is_active` (boolean, default: false), `email_verified_at` (timestamp, nullable), `remember_token` (varchar, nullable), `created_at` (timestamp), `updated_at` (timestamp).
  - **Purpose**: Stores employee and admin data; `role` (employee/admin) drives Filament 3 dashboard visibility; `is_active` controls account activation.

- **Sessions**:
  - **Fields**: `id` (PK, varchar), `user_id` (int, FK to `users.id`), `ip_address` (varchar, nullable), `user_agent` (text, nullable), `payload` (text), `last_activity` (int).
  - **Purpose**: Tracks user sessions for secure authentication and activity monitoring.

- **Leave Types**:
  - **Fields**: `id` (PK, auto-increment), `name` (varchar, e.g., 'Casual', 'Earned'), `max_days` (int), `created_at` (timestamp), `updated_at` (timestamp).
  - **Purpose**: Defines available leave types and their maximum allowable days per year.

- **Leave Applications**:
  - **Fields**: `id` (PK, auto-increment), `user_id` (int, FK to `users.id`, not null, cascade delete), `leave_type_id` (int, FK to `leave_types.id`, not null), `start_date` (date), `end_date` (date), `days_taken` (int), `reason` (text), `status` (varchar, enum: 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected', default: 'pending'), `admin_comment` (text, nullable), `created_at` (timestamp), `updated_at` (timestamp).
  - **Purpose**: Records leave requests, including duration, status, and admin feedback; linked to users and leave types.

- **Leave Balances**:
  - **Fields**: `id` (PK, auto-increment), `user_id` (int, FK to `users.id`, not null, cascade delete), `leave_type_id` (int, FK to `leave_types.id`, not null), `year` (year), `balance` (int), `created_at` (timestamp), `updated_at` (timestamp).
  - **Indexes**: Unique composite index on (`user_id`, `leave_type_id`, `year`) to prevent duplicate balances.
  - **Purpose**: Tracks annual leave balances per user and leave type; auto-updates on request submission/rejection.

### Relationships

- **Users ‚Üî Leave Applications**: One-to-many (`user_id` FK in `leave_applications`); a user can have multiple leave requests.
- **Users ‚Üî Leave Balances**: One-to-many (`user_id` FK in `leave_balances`); a user has multiple balance records (per leave type/year).
- **Leave Types ‚Üî Leave Applications**: One-to-many (`leave_type_id` FK in `leave_applications`); a leave type applies to multiple requests.
- **Leave Types ‚Üî Leave Balances**: One-to-many (`leave_type_id` FK in `leave_balances`); a leave type tracks balances for multiple users.
- **Users ‚Üî Sessions**: One-to-many (`user_id` FK in `sessions`); a user can have multiple active sessions.

### Design Principles

- **Normalization**: 3NF to minimize redundancy (e.g., separate `leave_types` and `leave_balances` tables).
- **Constraints**:
  - Primary keys (`id`, `email`) ensure uniqueness.
  - Foreign keys (`user_id`, `leave_type_id`) with cascade delete maintain referential integrity.
  - Unique constraints on `email` (users) and (`user_id`, `leave_type_id`, `year`) (leave_balances).
  - Enum `status` in `leave_applications` enforces valid states.
- **Indexing**: Indexes on `user_id`, `leave_type_id`, `start_date`, and `end_date` for fast queries (e.g., leave history, balance checks).
- **Scalability**: Partition-ready for `leave_applications` (e.g., by year) to handle large datasets.
- **Holidays**: Assumed to be managed programmatically or via a separate `holidays` table (not provided but implied), excluding weekends and public holidays from `days_taken` calculations.

### Notes

- **Holidays**: The system excludes Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays from leave calculations, using a `holidays` table.
- **Balance Updates**: `leave_balances.balance` is deducted on request submission and restored if rejected, ensuring real-time accuracy.
- **ER Diagram**: `er_diagram.png` reflects these tables and relationships.

## Web Application Security

The system prioritizes security, leveraging Filament 3 and Laravel features:

- **Authentication**:
  - Filament Authentication with Bcrypt-hashed passwords.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) via `role` field, enforced in Filament policies.
  - Employees cannot access admin pages; visibility is dynamically hidden.

- **Data Protection**:
  - HTTPS for secure communication.
  - CSRF tokens (Laravel middleware) prevent cross-site attacks.

- **Database Security**:
  - Eloquent ORM prevents SQL injection with parameterized queries.
  - `.env` files (excluded from Git) store sensitive credentials.

- **Session Management**:
  - Encrypted cookies for secure sessions.
  - Configurable timeouts to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Additional Measures**:
  - Rate limiting on login attempts(5 attempts per minute).
  - Input validation (e.g., leave dates, emails) in Filament forms.
  - Regular Composer updates to patch vulnerabilities.

## Coding Standards

The codebase follows strict standards for maintainability:

- **PHP Standards**:
  - [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) for style (4-space indentation, camelCase).
  - Consistent naming (e.g., `LeaveRequestResource`, `leave_requests`).

- **Laravel/Filament Conventions**:
  - Filament resources (e.g., `UserResource`, `LeaveApplicationResource`) for dashboard pages.
  - Routes in `routes/web.php` with RESTful names (e.g., `leave.request.store`).

- **Code Quality**:
  - Type hints and return types for robustness.
  - Docblocks for classes/methods.

## Key Features

- **User Management**:
  - Employees register; admins activate accounts via Filament Dashboard.
  - Role-based dashboard visibility (employee/admin).

- **Leave Request**:
  - Employees submit Casual/Earned leave requests in Filament.
  - Admins approves or rejects.

- **Leave Balance**:
  - Real-time balance tracking in Filament dashboard.
  - Deducts leave balance when submitting application.
  - Restores leave balance when Rejected.

- **Holidays**:
  - Excludes weekends and holidays, managed in Filament.
  - Ensures accurate leave calculations.

- **Reports**:
  - Employees view their own leave history/summaries in Filament.
  - Admins see all of the employee's history/summaries.
